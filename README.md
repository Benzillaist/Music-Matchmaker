# Music-Matchmaker - Team 22

## Project Description:
**Problem:**

We struggle to find people with similar music tastes! Given the number of musical artists, it can be difficult to find other people with the same preferences that we do. We have found that many of our friends have similar music tastes, and think that pairing people together by music taste might help make good friend groups!

**Solution:**

Music Matchmaker: a web-app that forms groups of people based on their music tastes.

**Key Features:**

User profile:
Users can specify an ideal range for group size
Users can link their music account (Apple music, Spotify, Youtube music)

Pairing algorithm:
An algorithm groups people up depending on their music preferences and ideal group sizes, and shares peopleâ€™s contact information with other members of the group
If time allows, we will allow people to be part of multiple groups
Music recommendation:
Once a group is created, an algorithm recommends a number of songs that they think everyone would like to listen to
If time allows: we will automatically make a playlist in each of the music services that users in the group have.

**Why This Project:**

Given that everyone has specific tastes in music, but have different music listening platforms, this app helps enable cross-platform music enjoyment! We like music, and like the idea of making more friends!
